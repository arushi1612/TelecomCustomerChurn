# Project Overview
Telecom customer churn prediction involves identifying which customers are likely to cancel their subscription to a telecom service based on their usage patterns and behaviors. This is particularly crucial in the telecom industry, where retaining customers is essential for maintaining a stable and profitable business.
# Why is it important?
Customer churn is a prevalent issue across various sectors, including the telecom industry. To grow as a telecom company, substantial investment is required to acquire new clients. When a customer leaves, it represents a significant loss of investment. The time and effort spent on acquiring and servicing that customer need to be redirected towards replacing them. By predicting when a telecom customer is likely to leave and offering them incentives to stay, a company can achieve considerable savings. This proactive approach not only retains customers but also enhances overall business efficiency and profitability.
